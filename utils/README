The border/coastline data used by basemap can be updated it two ways:

A) Download the GSHHS shapefiles and use them
B) Use GMT if you already have it installed, and avoid the download.

The preferred method is to use the GSHHS shapefiles.

Option A - GSHHS Shapefiles
---------------------------

1) Download the shapefile formatted versions of GSHHS and extract them in the
   "utils" directory. The data is available at: 
   https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/
   (Last updated with: ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gshhg/gshhg-shp-2.3.5-1.zip)
2) Run readboundaries_shp.py.

Option B - Generic Mapping Tools
--------------------------------

1) Install GMT. Note that you may need to install a separate gmt-suplemental
   package to get "gmt gshhg" on some systems.  
2) Download gshhg native binary-formatted data from 
   https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/
   (Last updated using: ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gshhg/gshhg-bin-2.3.5.zip)
3) run dumpbounds.sh to create states, countries, rivers text files.
4) run readboundaries.py to process into binary files, with metadata in
   separate text files.
